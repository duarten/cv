\section{Summary}

\cvitem{}{Software engineer with a strong background in concurrent programming and kernel programming. Currently immersed in distributed systems and high-performance, low-latency software.}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{Aug 2013 \hfill \newline \textit{now}}{Software Engineer}{Midokura}{}{}{Works as a software engineer on MidoNet, a virtual network platform for IaaS clouds. Focuses on the architecture and implementation of the core network controller, a distributed and highly concurrent software written in Java and Scala. Responsibilities include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item defining and implementing network controller features (e.g., resource protection, cross-site peering, L4 load balancing, etc.), 
\item defining and implementing cross-controller features (e.g., distributed flow state management and replication, port migration, NAT port reservation, etc.) 
\item performance and scalability improvements (e.g., measuring and accelerating the packet processing pipeline, reducing memory footprint, scaling the on-ramp and off-ramp gateways, re-write of the userspace netlink library, etc.)
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Jun 2012 \hfill \newline Jul 2013}{Software Engineer}{Nokia Siemens Networks}{}{}{Worked as a software engineer and architect on large-scale brownfield Java projects concerning the planning and management of large multi-layer optical networks. Responsibilities included: enforcement of architectural constraints, code review, hands-on knowledge sharing workshops (mainly about concurrent programming and software development), design and implementation of infrastructure modules. Lead the engineering of a concurrent and efficient component to mediate between the planning and evolution of a network and the real-time events generated by its physical, deployed representation.}
