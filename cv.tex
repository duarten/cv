\section{Summary}

\cvitem{}{Software engineer, always looking for new and challenging problems to solve. Strong background in concurrent programming and kernel programming. \newline\newline Currently immersed in functional programming and distributed systems.}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{Aug 2013 \hfill \newline \textit{now}}{Software Engineer}{Midokura}{}{}{Works as a software engineer on MidoNet, a virtual network platform for IaaS clouds. Focuses on the architecture and implementation of the core network controller, a distributed and highly concurrent software written in Java and Scala, as well as on its integration with cloud orchestration platforms, namely OpenStack.}
\cvitem{}{} 

\cventry{Jun 2012 \hfill \newline Jul 2013}{Software Architect}{Nokia Siemens Networks}{}{}{Worked as a software architect on large-scale brownfield Java projects concerning the planning and management of large multi-layer optical networks. Responsibilities included: enforcement of architecture constraints, code review, hands-on knowledge sharing workshops (mainly about concurrent programming and software development), design and implementation of infrastructure modules. Lead the engineering of a concurrent and efficient component to mediate between the planning and evolution of a network and the real-time events generated by it's physical, deployed representation.}
